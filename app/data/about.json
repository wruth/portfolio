I’ve been developing Front End user experiences since the late nineties, and hammering code together since shortly after the development of the astrolabe. I enjoy big challenges like architecting complex new sites from scratch, or wrapping my head around gnarly legacy code in order to extend and improve it. I take a craftsman’s pride in what I build, and believe solutions should be solid: well-designed, clearly and cleanly implemented, and thoroughly documented and tested. I enjoy working with and leading smart dedicated teams, and with them delivering something great that enables people to accomplish and discover more in their interactive experiences. Send me an email, I’d love to talk to you about contributing to your project.</p>"
